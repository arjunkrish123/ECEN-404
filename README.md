Team 52 - Instrument for the Identification of Live and Dead Bacteria (URS)

**Executive Summary**: 
The identification of live and dead bacteria is a challenging task. Conventional methods of identification, requiring days and specialized equipment, are quite time-consuming and inappropriate in settings requiring prompt, in-situ diagnosis. With a rise in health care-associated infection (HAI) due to bacteria, as well as growing antibiotic resistance, a rather urgent need for the efficient detection and assessment of bacterial infections exists. To address this need, a portable fluorescence spectrometer will be constructed. The spectrometer will consist of excitation and emission monochromators, ultraviolet (UV) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and a graphical user interface (GUI). An on-board UV LED will be utilized as a means of disinfection. The spectrometer will be capable of performing both normal fluorescence and synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy on bacterial samples. The normal fluorescence and synchronous fluorescence spectra of bacteria, before and after UV disinfection, may be recorded and processed through principal component analysis (PCA) on a computer. Moreover, a GUI will facilitate the acquisition, processing, and display of spectra. To that effect, live and dead bacteria will be rapidly distinguished, within minutes. These results will support a novel, efficient, and portable means of identifying live and dead bacteria in-situ.
